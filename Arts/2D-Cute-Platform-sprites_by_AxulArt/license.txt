Includes:
    Tile set for a 2D Platform Game
    Tile set for over world
    Player's characters sprites (Girl, Boy and Template)
    Enemies sprites
    Pixel font & collectable items

This was added and changed in the last update:
    Changed the color and transparency of some tiles
    the colors of the blue and green golem were reversed
    The other overworld enemies were added: (golems, slime, bunny, lizard, stone sun and snail)

Note: You can flip, some of the over world characters, to make the illusion of moving animation (like Final Fantasy 4 sprites).
